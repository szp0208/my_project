Likewise, palmitate oxidation was markedly lower in the hearts of EC-ATG7(-/-) mice versus wild-type  mice during reperfusion of ischemic hearts. Although hearts from EC-ATG7(-/-) mice revealed significantly lower triacylglycerol content compared with those from wild-type mice, ATG7-silenced human umbilical vein endothelial cells demonstrated appreciably lower fatty acid binding protein 4 and 5 expression relative to those treated with scrambled small interfering RNA. 	30195591

61	29	CTSD	Sabine Koch, 2011	Electron microscopy revealed that there were significantly greater numbers of readily releasable synaptic vesicles present in Ctsd mice than in wild-type control mice as early as postnatal day 16. The size of this synaptic vesicle pool continued to increase with disease progression in the hippocampus and thalamus of the Ctsd mice. Electrophysiology revealed a markedly decreased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) with no effect on paired-pulse modulation of the evoked excitatory post synaptic potentials in the hippocampus of Ctsd mice. hese data indicate that CTSD is required for normal synaptic function and that a failure in synaptic trafficking or recycling may bean early and important pathologic mechanism in Ctsd mice	22082660	
62	29	CTSD	Sabine Koch, 2011	CTSD deficiency leads to pronounced myelin changes in the murine brain: myelin-related proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein were both markedly reduced at postnatal day 24, and the amount of lipids characteristically high in myelin (e.g. plasmalogen-derived alkenyl chains and glycosphingolipid-derived 20- and 24-carbon acyl chains) were significantly lowered compared with controls. CTSD knockout brains there was a pronounced accumulation of cholesteryl esters and abnormal levels of proteins related to cholesterol transport, with an increased content of apolipoprotein E and a reduced content of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1.	22082660

69	30	CTSL	Desmond J Tobin, 2002	Hair follicle morphogenesis in ctsl(-/-) mice was associated with several abnormalities. Defective terminal differentiation of keratinocytes occurred during the formation of the hair canal, resulting in disruption of hair shaft outgrowth. Both proliferation and apoptosis levels in keratinocytes and melanocytes were higher in ctsl(-/-) than in ctsl(+/+) hair follicles. The development of the hair follicle pigmentary unit was disrupted by vacuolation of  differentiating melanocytes. Hair cycling was also abnormal in ctsl(-/-) mice. A hallmark of these ctsl(-/-) mice was the severe disruption in the exiting of hair shafts to the skin surface. 	12000732

There were less expressions of aggrecan, type-II collagen and VEGF in the intervertebral discs of HIF1-alpha KO mice than in those of wild-type mice. Taken together, the results of our study indicated that HIF-1alpha is a pivotal contributor to NPC survival and the homeotasis of extracellular matrix through the HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling  pathway, and plays an important role in the development of disc degeneration.	24067457

There is an increase in activity of rate-limiting enzymes of the mitochondria in the muscles  of HIF-1alpha KOs, indicating that the citric acid cycle and increased fatty acid oxidation may be compensating for decreased flow through the glycolytic pathway. 	15328538

113	51	MFN2	Ting Zhao, 2012	specific deletion of MFN2 in cardiomyocytes caused extensive accumulation of autophagosomes. In particular, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a critical step in autophagic degradation, was markedly retarded without altering the formation of autophagosomes and lysosomes in response to ischemia-reperfusion stress. Hearts from cardiac-specific MFN2 knock-out mice had abnormal mitochondrial and cellular metabolism and were vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion challenge.	22619176	
114	51	MFN2	Jonathan M Gall, 2012	 MFN2 cKO caused severe mitochondrial fragmentation in renal epithelial cells that are critical for normal kidney tubular function. However, despite a small (20%) decrease in nephron number, newborn cKO pups had organ or tubular function that did not differ from littermate Cre-negative pups. MFN2 deficiency in proximal tubule epithelial cells in primary culture induced mitochondrial fragmentation but did not significantly  alter ATP turnover, maximal mitochondrial oxidative reserve capacity, or the low  level of oxygen consumption during cyanide exposure. MFN2 deficiency also did not increase apoptosis of tubule epithelial cells under non-stress conditions. 	22292091

Inhibition of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling system through genetic deletion of the insulin receptor alone or in combination with the IGF-1 receptor or treatment with rapamycin prevented hyperphosphorylation of S6RP without affecting the mitochondrial structural defect, alleviated renal disease, and delayed the onset of kidney failure in PHB2-deficient animals. 	25643582

122	59	PINK1	Lianteng Zhi, 2019	single pulse-evoked DA release in the  dorsal striatum of PINK1 KO mice was decreased in an age-dependent manner. Furthermore, the decrease was because of less DA release instead of an alteration of DA transporter function or DA terminal degeneration. We also found that PINK1  KO striatal slices had significantly lower basal mitochondria respiration compared with that of WT controls, and this impairment was also age-dependent.

137	59	PINK1	Laura J Flinn, 2013	There was also marked microglial activation in pink(-/-) larvae, but depletion of microglia failed to rescue the dopaminergic neuron loss, arguing against microglial activation being a key factor in the pathogenesis.Pink1(-/-) zebrafish are the first vertebrate model of PINK1 deficiency with loss of dopaminergic neurons.	24027110	
138	59	PINK1	Hilary K Siddall, 2013	 Cardiomyocytes isolated from PINK1-/- hearts had a lower resting mitochondrial membrane potential, had inhibited mitochondrial respiration, generated more oxidative stress during simulated IRI, and underwent rigor contracture more rapidly in response to an uncoupler when compared to PINK1+/+ cells suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction in hearts deficient in PINK1.We show that the loss of PINK1 increases the heart's vulnerability to ischemia-reperfusion injury.	23638067	
139	59	PINK1	Insup Choi, 2013	results suggest that PINK1 deficiency causes astrocytes dysfunction, which may contribute to the development of PD due to delayed astrocytes-mediated repair of microenvironment in the brain.	23440919	
140	59	PINK1	Madeleine Diedrich, 2011	three brain regions investigated are the midbrain, which is the location of substantia  nigra; striatum, the major efferent region of substantia nigra; and cerebral cortex, which is more distal to PD pathology. In all three regions, mitochondrial proteins responsible for energy metabolism and membrane potential were significantly altered in the PINK1-KO mice, but with very different region specific accents in terms of up/down-regulations. Cerebral cortex tissues showed the mildest level of protein oxidation in both PINK1-KO and wild tye mice, indicating either a better oxidative protection or less reactive oxygen species (ROS) pressure in this brain region.	21943346	
141	59	PINK1	Suzana Gispert, 2009	In contrast to the strong effect of PINK1 on mitochondrial dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster and in spite of reduced expression of fission factor Mtp18, we show reduced fission and increased aggregation of mitochondria only under stress in PINK1-deficient mouse neurons.Thus, aging Pink1(-/-) mice show increasing mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in impaired neural activity similar to PD, in absence of overt neuronal death.

149	61	PRKAA1	Miranda M Sung, 2015	Despite the well-documented role of AMPK in controlling myocardial energy metabolism, there was no difference in basal glucose and fatty acid oxidation rates between beta1beta2M(AMPKbeta1beta2-deficient mice)-KO and WT mice. However, there was reduced AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of troponin I in beta1beta2M-KO and reduced ventricular cell shortening in the presence of low Ca(2+), which may explain the  impaired cardiac function in these mice. Interestingly, beta1beta2M-KO mice did not display any signs of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy, which could be attributed to impaired activation of p38 MAPK. CONCLUSIONS: beta1beta2M-KO mice display evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy. 	26023060

236	106	APP	Frances Corrigan, 2012	APP knockout mice displayed significantly worse cognitive and  motor deficits, as demonstrated by the Barnes Maze and rotarod respectively, than APP wildtype mice.

248	106	APP	K J Lee, 2010	 In an in vivo experiment, we found that cortical layers II/III and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in 1 year-old APP-deficient mice had fewer and shorter dendritic spines than wild-type littermates.

250	106	APP	G R Seabrook, 1999	the impaired synaptic plasticity in APP deficient mice is associated with abnormal neuronal morphology and synaptic function within the hippocampus.	10219973	
251	106	APP	Phan H Truong, 2019	The acute cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination revealed that whereas axons in the corpus callosum of WT and APLP2-KO mice underwent similar degrees of demyelination and subsequent remyelination, the myelinated callosal axons in APP-KO mice were less susceptible to cuprizone-induced demyelination and showed a failure in remyelination after cuprizone withdrawal.	30506868	
252	106	APP	Ilaria Canobbio, 2017	in a model of vein thrombosis induced by flow restriction in the inferior vena cava, APP-KO mice, as well as chimeric mice with selective deficiency of APP in blood cells, developed much larger thrombi than control animals, and were more sensitive to embolization. APP-KO mice displayed a shorter APTT, but not PT, when measured in the presence of platelets. PP-KO mice presented a higher number of circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates, and neutrophils displayed a greater tendency to protrude extracellular traps, which were more strongly incorporated into venous thrombi.	28611024	
253	106	APP	Chengyu Zou, 2016	When housed under environmental enrichment, APP-KO mice failed to respond with an increase in spine density. The cognitive deficit observed in APP-KO mice was also rescued by D-serine treatment.	27572463	
254	106	APP	Xiaomin Zhang, 2016	Spectral analyses showed that network oscillations within the theta- and gamma-frequency bands were not different between APP-KO and wild-type mice. Surprisingly, however, while gamma amplitude coupled to theta phase in all recorded regions of wild-type animals, in APP-KO mice theta-gamma coupling was strongly diminished in recordings from the parietal cortex and hippocampus, but not in LFPs recorded from the prefrontal cortex.
	26905287	
255	106	APP	Tracy Ho, 2012	The function of the retina was assessed using the electroretinogram and although the rod photoreceptor responses were similar in APP-KO and WT mice, the post-photoreceptor, inner retinal responses of both the rod and cone pathways were reduced in APP-KO mice.	22279552	
256	106	APP	An Liu, 2019	We demonstrate that both sucrose-induced neurotransmission and synaptic depletion in response to high frequency stimulation are significantly enhanced in APP KO compared to wild type littermates. The level of phosphorylated forms of synapsins, but not total synapsins, is elevated in the KO mice. We show that the inhibition of L-type calcium channels normalizes phosphorylated synapsins and slows down the high frequency induced synaptic depletion in APP KO mice.	29052089	
257	106	APP	De-En Xu, 2014	APP KO and APP-overexpressing transgenic (APP TG) mice exhibited a decreased and an increased thickness of myelin in spinal cords, respectively, although the changes are limited in comparison to their littermate WT mice. The thickness of myelin in APP KO sciatic nerve also increased in comparison to that in WT mice.	25482638	
258	106	APP	Yann Senechal, 2008	The absence of APP expression in APP KO mice was confirmed at the protein level using hippocampal tissue in Western blotting. APP KO mice displayed deficits in forelimb grip strength and locomotor activity in agreement with previous studies. In the Y-maze test used for spontaneous alternation behaviour, APP KO animals did not exhibit reduced alternation rates. On the other hand, in the passive avoidance test, APP KO mice showed an age-related deficit in retention of memory for an aversive experience.

263	113	GPR65	Yoshiko Onozawa, 2012	BTB09089 was found to be a TDAG8 specific agonist. We then investigated the effects of BTB09089 on T cells and macrophages in vitro. In splenocytes, BTB09089 suppressed the production of IL-2 stimulated with anti-CD3  and anti-CD28 antibodies. In peritoneal exuded macrophages induced by thioglycollate, BTB09089 suppressed the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 while it increased that of IL-10 when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. These effects were observed in cells from wild type mice, but not those from TDAG8 knockout mice.	22445881	
264	113	GPR65	Shih-Ping Dai, 2017	Suppressed TDAG8 expression delayed the onset of inflammatory hyperalgesia and shortened hyperalgesic time in mice.

279	114	GRN	Hideyuki Takahashi, 2017	PGRN-deficient APP/PS1 mice also exhibit less severe axonal dystrophy and partially improved behavior phenotypes. While PGRN deficiency reduces these amyloidosis-related phenotypes, other neuronal injury mechanisms are increased by loss of PGRN, revealing a multidimensional interaction of GRN with AD.	28070672	
280	114	GRN	Yi Fu, 2017	GRN-deficient mice significantly exacerbated cardiorenal injury as evidenced by higher levels of urinary albumin excretion, more severe renal morphological injuries, including pronounced glomerular basement membrane thickening and podocyte foot process effacement, and adverse myocardial remodeling versus wild-type mice.	27872232	
281	114	GRN	Lutz Menzel, 2017	Grn(-/-) mice displayed increased perilesional axonal injury even though the overall brain tissue loss and neurological consequences were similar to wild-type mice.	27778404	
282	114	GRN	Wenjun Yan, 2016	we show that PGRN-deficient mice display heightened mortality in models of polymicrobial sepsis and endotoxinemia, with increased tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and reduced IL-10 production.	27619993	
283	114	GRN	Fanhua Wei, 2014	PGRN-deficient mice became highly susceptible to DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis, whereas recombinant PGRN ameliorated the pathology and reduced the histological score in both DSS and TNBS colitis models.	25387791	
284	114	GRN	Yun-Peng Zhao, 2015	we found that deficiency of PGRN led to spontaneous OA-like phenotype in 'aged' mice.  PGRN-deficient mice exhibited exaggerated breakdown of cartilage structure and OA progression, while  local delivery of recombinant PGRN protein attenuated degradation of cartilage matrix and protected against OA development in surgically induced OA models.	25169730

288	115	HTT	M T Usdin, 1999	Mutant mice showed less post-tetanic potentiation than wild-type animals, and also showed decreased paired pulse facilitation, suggesting that excitatory synapses in HD mutant mice are impaired in their ability to sustain transmission during repetitive stimulation.	10196373	
289	116	IRGM	Andre Bafica, 2007	LRG47-deficient mice are highly susceptible to LPS, but not TLR2 ligand-induced shock, an outcome that correlates with enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. LPS-stimulated LRG47-deficient macrophages display enhanced phosphorylation of p38, a downstream response associated with TLR4/MyD88 rather than IFN-beta/STAT-1 signaling.	17911638	
290	116	IRGM	Helton C Santiago, 2005	o investigate the possible role of LRG-47 in IFN-gamma-dependent control of T. cruzi infection, LRG-47 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were infected with the Y strain of this parasite, and host responses were analyzed. When assayed on day 12 after parasite inoculation,  LRG-47 KO mice, in contrast to IFN-gamma KO mice, controlled early parasitemia almost as effectively as WT animals. However, the infected LRG-47 KO mice displayed a rebound in parasite growth on day 15, and all succumbed to the infection by day 19. Additional analysis indicated that LRG-47-deficient mice exhibit unimpaired proinflammatory responses throughout the infection. Instead, reactivated disease in the KO animals was associated with severe splenic and thymic atrophy, anemia, and thrombocytopenia not observed in their WT counterparts. In addition, in vitro studies revealed that IFN-gamma-stimulated LRG-47 KO macrophages display defective intracellular killing of amastigotes despite normal expression of TNF and NO synthetase type 2 and that both NO synthetase type 2 and LRG-47 are required for optimum IFN-gamma-dependent restriction of parasite growth.	16339555	
291	116	IRGM	Yanan Gao, 2016	At the acute stage of S. japonicum infection, in contrast to WT mice, LRG-47(-/-) mice showed the significantly decreased egg burden, low schistosome-specific antibody response, and the decreased Th1 and increased Tc1 responses. 	26660918	
292	116	IRGM	C M Collazo, 2001	After infection with T. gondii, LRG-47-deficient mice succumbed uniformly and rapidly during the acute phase of the infection; in contrast, IRG-47-deficient mice displayed only partially decreased resistance that was not manifested until the chronic phase. After infection with L. monocytogenes, LRG-47-deficient mice exhibited a profound loss of resistance, whereas IRG-47-deficient mice exhibited completely normal resistance. In addition, both strains displayed normal clearance of MCMV. Thus, LRG-47 and IRG-47 have vital, but distinct roles in immune defense against protozoan and bacterial infections.	11457893	
293	117	LRRK2	Makoto Kubo, 2016	LRRK2(-/-) mice had significantly higher counts of peritoneal  B1 cells than wild-type mice. After BCR stimulation, phosphor-Erk1/2 of splenic B2 cells was enhanced to a higher degree in LRRK2(-/-) mice. 	26943952	
294	117	LRRK2	Ben Wu, 2016	While surveying a LRRK2 knockout mouse strain, we found that old animals developed age-dependent hepatic vascular growths similar to cavernous hemangiomas.

299	117	LRRK2	Youren Tong, 2012	LRRK2-/- kidneys at 20 months of age develop striking accumulation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins, impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, and increases in apoptotic cell death, inflammatory responses and oxidative damage.	22988862	
300	117	LRRK2	Martin C Herzig, 2011	Mice completely lacking the LRRK2 protein (knock-out, KO) showed an early-onset (age 6 weeks) marked increase in number and size of secondary lysosomes in kidney proximal tubule cells and lamellar bodies in lung type II cells. Mice expressing a LRRK2 kinase-dead (KD) mutant from the endogenous locus  displayed similar early-onset pathophysiological changes in kidney but not lung.  KD mutants had dramatically reduced full-length LRRK2 protein levels in the kidney and this genetic effect was mimicked pharmacologically in wild-type mice	21828077	
301	117	LRRK2	Xian Lin, 2009	in transgenic mice that although overexpression of LRRK2 alone did not cause neurodegeneration, the presence of excess LRRK2 greatly accelerated the progression of neuropathological abnormalities developed in PD-related A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Moreover, we found that LRRK2 promoted the abnormal aggregation and somatic accumulation of alpha-synuclein in  A53T mice, which likely resulted from the impairment of microtubule dynamics, Golgi organization, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.	20064389	
302	117	LRRK2	Tatsunori Maekawa, 2012	the transgenic brain showed several neurological abnormalities such as a reduced striatal dopamine content, fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus in DA neurons, and an increased degree of microtubule polymerization.	22534020	
303	117	LRRK2	Ravindra Boddu, 2015	The cortex and medulla of LRRK2 KO rat kidneys become darkly pigmented in early adulthood, yet aged animals display no overt signs of kidney failure. Accompanying the dark pigment we find substantial macrophage infiltration in LRRK2 KO kidneys, suggesting the presence of chronic inflammation that may predispose to kidney disease. Unexpectedly, the dark kidneys of the LRRK2 KO rats are highly resistant to rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury compared with  wild-type rats.	25904107	
304	117	LRRK2	Eva Andres-Mateos, 2009	we show that LRRK2 KO mice are viable and have no major abnormalities and live to adulthood.

309	118	MECP2	Huda Y Zoghbi, 2005	The phenotypic spectrum of MECP2 mutations is broad and includes mental retardation with or without seizures, Angelman syndrome-like phenotype, and autism. Mecp308/Y mice carry a truncating mutation and display many of the features seen in Rett syndrome. Social behavior abnormalities and impaired social interactions in Mecp308/Y mice suggest that MeCP2 plays a role in modulating the activity of genes and neurons important for  social interactions. Mice that overexpress MeCP2 at twice the endogenous levels develop a progressive neurologic disorder, demonstrating that MeCP2 levels are tightly regulated and raising the possibility that duplications or gain-of-function mutations of MECP2 might underlie some cases of neurodevelopmental X-linked disorders.	16225828

312	122	PSEN1	Xiao-Wei Song, 2018	PSEN1 knockout in adults mice led to decreased muscle fibers, widened sarcomere Z lines and reduced lengths of sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes. Cardiovascular loss of function of PSEN1 induced by Sm22a-Cre or Myh6-Cre/ER/tamoxifen also resulted in severe ultrastructural abnormalities, such as relaxed gap junctions between neighboring cardiomyocytes.  Functionally, cardiovascular deletion of PSEN1 caused spontaneous mortality from  birth to adulthood and led to diastolic heart dysfunction, including decreased volume of the left ventricle at the end-systolic and end-diastolic stages. Additionally, in a myocardial ischemia model, deletion of PSEN1 in the cardiovascular system first protected mice by inducing adaptive hypertrophy but ultimately resulted in severe heart failure.	28617969
